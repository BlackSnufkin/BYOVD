# BYOVD (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver)

**BYOVD** is a collection of Proof of Concepts (PoCs) showcasing the exploitation of vulnerable drivers to terminate processes protected by AV/EDR solutions. This technique allows attackers to disable security software by leveraging flaws in signed drivers. These drivers are either not included in the Microsoft recommended driver block rules or not listed in the [LOLDrivers](https://www.loldrivers.io/) project (as of 12/08/2023). 

However, since the initial discovery, the **TfSysMon** driver has been added to the LOLDrivers project and has also been abused by ransomware groups, as reported by Sophos. Attackers used the driver as part of a **BYOVD** technique to disable endpoint protection, as highlighted in [this blog post](https://sophos.com/news/2024/08/14/ransomware-attackers-introduce-new-edr-killer).

## Overview
The **BYOVD technique** has recently gained popularity in offensive security, particularly with the release of tools such as SpyBoy's *Terminator* (sold for $3,000) and the *ZeroMemoryEx Blackout* project. These tools capitalize on vulnerable drivers to disable AV/EDR agents, facilitating further attacks by reducing detection.

This repository contains several PoCs developed for educational purposes, helping researchers understand how these drivers can be abused to terminate processes.

## POCs
Below are the drivers and their respective PoCs available in this repository:

- **[Ksapi64-Killer](https://github.com/BlackSnufkin/BYOVD/tree/main/Ksapi64-Killer)**: Targets `ksapi64.sys` and `ksapi64_del.sys`.
- **[TfSysMon-Killer](https://github.com/BlackSnufkin/BYOVD/tree/main/TfSysMon-Killer)**: Targets `sysmon.sys` from ThreatFire System Monitor.
- **[Viragt64-Killer](https://github.com/BlackSnufkin/BYOVD/tree/main/Viragt64-Killer)**: Targets `viragt64.sys` from Tg Soft.


## Detailed Driver Analysis

This project is inspired by Alice Climent-Pommeret's blog post, [Finding and Exploiting Process Killer Drivers with LOL for $3000](https://alice.climent-pommeret.red/posts/process-killer-driver/), which explains how to identify and exploit process-killing drivers. The key takeaway from this research is how to systematically find **new vulnerable drivers** that can be abused to disable AV/EDR protections. Below are the most important elements to focus on from the research to discover and exploit such drivers.

### Key Insights for Finding New Vulnerable Drivers:
1. **Focus on IOCTL Codes**: The heart of exploiting drivers lies in understanding **IOCTL (Input/Output Control) codes**. IOCTLs allow communication between user-mode applications and kernel-mode drivers. Vulnerable drivers can expose dangerous functions through these IOCTL codes, such as terminating processes or accessing protected resources.

2. **Look for Specific Function Imports**: In vulnerable drivers, look for functions that indicate process manipulation capabilities:
   - **ZwOpenProcess** or **NtOpenProcess**: These functions allow a driver to obtain a handle to any process, a necessary step before terminating it.
   - **ZwTerminateProcess** or **NtTerminateProcess**: These functions allow a driver to forcibly terminate a process.
   
   By finding drivers that import ZwTerminateProcess, you can identify candidates that may have the ability to kill processes.

3. **Leverage LOLDrivers Database**: Use the **LOLDrivers** project, which centralizes information about known vulnerable drivers. This database provides detailed technical data about drivers and their imported functions, giving you a head start in identifying potential candidates for exploitation.

4. **Reverse Engineer Driver Logic**: Once you’ve identified a driver, reverse-engineer its IOCTL handling logic. **Focus on understanding how it processes commands**, particularly those sent via the `IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL` function. This is where you’ll find whether an IOCTL code corresponds to dangerous operations like process termination or access to sensitive resources.

### The Approach to Finding New Drivers:
To discover new vulnerable drivers, you can adopt the following structured approach:

1. **Identify Driver Candidates**: Use the LOLDrivers project or your own collection of drivers to find those that import critical functions such as `ZwOpenProcess` and `ZwTerminateProcess`. A driver importing both indicates potential for process termination abuse.

2. **Analyze IOCTL Codes**: After identifying a candidate driver, examine how it processes IOCTL codes. Look for patterns that allow user-mode applications to send commands for terminating processes. Focus on IOCTL codes mapped to `IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL`, as this is where most critical functionality resides.

3. **Create Proof of Concept (PoC)**: Once you’ve reverse-engineered the vulnerable IOCTL logic, you can create a PoC to exploit the driver. The PoC should interact with the driver by sending the appropriate IOCTL code, along with a handle or PID of the target process to terminate it.

### Example of This Process in Action:
The blog by Alice Climent-Pommeret provides two case studies of vulnerable drivers (`AswArPot.sys` and `kEvP64.sys`), showing how they were exploited using this methodology. These drivers were found to expose process-killing capabilities through specific IOCTL codes, and the steps to reverse engineer and develop a PoC were outlined.

Following this method, you can identify new vulnerable drivers by:
- Searching for critical function imports,
- Understanding how the driver processes IOCTL codes,
- And leveraging LOLDrivers or similar resources to accelerate your search.

### IRP Major Functions of Interest:
When investigating drivers, pay close attention to the following IRP (I/O Request Packet) major functions. These are key to understanding how drivers handle user requests:
- **`IRP_MJ_CREATE`**: Called when communication with the driver is established.
- **`IRP_MJ_CLOSE`**: Called when communication is terminated.
- **`IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL`**: Critical for exploitation; used for sending IOCTL codes to drivers. Most process-killing vulnerabilities will be handled through this function.

### The Path to Exploitation:
1. **Driver Identification**: Find drivers that import `ZwOpenProcess` and `ZwTerminateProcess`.
2. **IOCTL Analysis**: Reverse engineer how IOCTLs are handled, focusing on dangerous commands like process termination.
3. **Exploit Development**: Write a PoC that interacts with the driver through the vulnerable IOCTL code, passing the necessary parameters to terminate a target process.

By following these steps, you can systematically find and exploit vulnerable drivers, similar to the process outlined in Alice’s [full blog post](https://alice.climent-pommeret.red/posts/process-killer-driver/).
